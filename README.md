# Treball de Recerca
This is a year-long school project, where I challenged myself to learn how to code in Java as the main objective of the project, and I decided to do just that by making an Android app with Android Studio. This is the result of said effort.

## What is this app about

This app presents you some very popular physics, math, and general enginerring formulas so that you can fill the varibles, leave blank what you want to know, and the app gives you the result back.


## Play Store
I've uploaded this app to Play Store, and you can find it in [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jafeth.testandroid) link.
